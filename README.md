# FinalICS3U-02
Final Project ICS3U-02 2018-19
This final project will give you an opportunity to demonstrate an understanding of the programming concepts learned throughout the course.  You will be expected to follow the stages of software development (group and individual):
1. planning
2. design
3. coding
4. debugging
5. testing
6. documentation (this is not referring to comments)
7. final testing
8. delivery
9. Showcase
10. Finish documentation and reports
11. Package up your program for any PC/laptop that can run an executable.  

Note: These steps may and should be worked on simultaneously, although this is the due date sequence tends to be in the order above, that is just due date, not work flow.

Assessment of this programming project takes into consideration both the process and the product at both group level and individual level since Project Management is part of the Curriculum Expectations.
 
Each step must be handed in on time.  A zero can be assigned on a section of the Final Task.
 
A Google Classroom Assignment Folder will be created for each major phase, but you will be also working in folders created in GitHub too.  Basically all documents are in and get handed into Google Classroom.  Teams will be created Wednesday May 15th to facilitate Team shares and all coding.  This is startup and major work will really begin the following day. 


#3a â€“ Implementation Shared Code: Due Date Thu. May 30th.

Everyone must have one or more pieces of class shared code in your project.  This can be a scoring routine, or a splash screen, or a help module, or instructions.  What is required will be determined on day two during the Scope documents and Planning.

Two main pieces to keep in mind;
Classes that are shared class wide (like scoring) have an earlier due Date
May 30/19  
Your individual work, the code, your main procedure and your group game. 

As you know, from other projects, this can be long and involved, depending upon your task(s).  It can also be frustrating.  

You CANNOT leave the group tasks to the last minute because your games will not work without the group tasks and proper testing and consultation. Your games must work, they cannot crash.  (Your group and possibly you, dependent upon your job, will be responsible for this phase of the project.)
 
Hints: Keep the problem and testing simple (KISS Principal), use versioning, do not continue until you have each small piece working, fitting together properly.  Use your log to record what you want to do the next day, keep focused.  Get help immediately from your group. Simple working code will earn a better mark than elaborate code that fails under certain conditions.  (Remember this piece is shared and your requirements AND the other groups requirements must be taken under consideration. (refer to Rubrics and job descriptions.)  Ensure that your code follows all normal conventions and works for all game types where common elements are being used in classes. Code that does not work is before a Level 1.
 
Communication Marks:  Your code MUST be commented appropriately including all sources including your classmates.  Failure to document properly will earn a zero on this section and
